A curated portfolio of my **data science projects**, combining **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization** into business-relevant insights. Every project is written for readability, reproducibility, and impact.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Transform raw data into actionable insight with clean code, strong analytics, and visual storytelling.  
> 🧰 **Core Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

```
data-science-portfolio/
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for analysis & modeling
├── data_files/         # Raw or cleaned data files (CSV, XLSX, JSON)
├── Visuals/            # Charts, plots, dashboards, and visuals
├── reports_package/    # PDF or Markdown summaries of findings
└── README.md           # You are here
```

Each directory supports a specific stage of the **data science workflow** — from exploration and modeling to communication of results.

## 📊 Featured Work

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries and visualization of data distributions.  
- Outlier detection, correlation heatmaps, and feature profiling.  
- Tools: **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**.

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning Models
- Regression, classification, and clustering experiments.  
- Model evaluation using RMSE, Accuracy, Precision/Recall, and F1.  
- Feature importance and explainability with **SHAP** and **Permutation Importance**.  
- Tools: **Scikit-Learn**, **Statsmodels**.

### 3️⃣ Reporting & Visualization
- Business-ready insights packaged in visual reports.  
- Automated visual pipelines (Matplotlib, Plotly, Power BI exports).  
- Clean chart design for dashboards and presentations.
